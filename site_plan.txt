WINE WEB SCRAPER:

1. Scrape the Waitrose red wine list online. Search by id for the title of each wine, and store those in a database.

2. Iterate through the wine names in the database and perform a search on vivino for those wines. Accept only an exact match on wine names to make sure it is the correct wine.

3. If name of Waitrose wine matches that of vivino, check star rating of wine. If 3.9* (arbitrary rating) or above, add the wine and a link to the wine to database. 

4. Very basic UI should allow a user to press 'search' button and then download(?) or view a list of highly rated wines sorted by rating with a link to each on waitrose website.
